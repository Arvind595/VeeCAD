Roger,

These files were produced with Ulticap for Windows Version 5.71 ( schematic capture )
and Uliboard for Windows Version 5.72

The netlist has the extension .nt0

I have also exported the Component placement file as I think you will need this as well
It contains the Refdes, Package info, number of pins etc.
