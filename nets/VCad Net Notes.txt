TinyCAD Schematic Export Formats
================================

- "TinyCAD" (useless)
- Pads
- Eagle
- Protel

Eagle
=====
TinyCAD and Multisim export very different "eagle" files.


Kicad Schematic Export Formats
==============================

- PCBNew  (Kicad native ?)
- Orcad PCB 2
- Cadstar


PCBNew
======

Possibly only for Kicad ?  Uses space as delimiter, but never emits
a space within a field, so solid. Some PCB New netlists from internet
may not be all that reliable, but my own simple tests emit files
with required fields all good.



Orcad PCB 2
===========

As each component pin is defined, it is assigned to a net, so there
is no need for a separate Nets section of the file.net.  Uses space
as delimiter, but seems to only allow spaces in value fields which
are the last field in a line and so is unambiguous.

Orcad PCB 2 Seems to be fairly standard. Windraft calls it just 
"Orcad".

Kicad emits Orcad PCB 2 that assigns a net named '?' to unconnected 
pins, which causes VeeCAD to (correctly) treat these pins as belonging
to the same net. That wreaks havoc especially auto routing.


Protel, Tango
=============
These tend to get confused!
MultiSim outputs these as identical! Orcad & Protel 99SE output Protel 
with '-' and Tango with ',' as net separator. 

VeeCAD treats Protel, Tango with same code, accepting either '-' or ','
separator.

PADS PCB
========
Separate component and nets sections, like Protel. Line based format.
