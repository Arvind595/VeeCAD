*PADS2000*


PADS POWERPCB FIRST LINE SAMPLES
================================
!PADS-POWERPCB-V2.0-BASIC! DESIGN DATABASE ASCII FILE 1.0
!PADS-POWERPCB-V3.5-MILS! NETLIST FILE FROM POWERLOGIC V3.5
!PADS-POWERPCB-V9.0-MILS-CP950! NETLIST FILE FROM PADS LOGIC V9.3
!PADS-POWERPCB-V9.4-MILS!

All of the above file formats are backwardly compatible - i.e. the original 
PADS=PCB program can read a POWER-PCB file. Compatibility is due to the same 
format for *PART* and *NET* sections.

BUGGY SAMPLE FILE
=================

The sample file "NETLIST MINI TESTER OC BOARD.asc" contains duplcate pin to 
net assignements. The end of line assignment is duplicated on the next line. 
Looks like a bug in POWERPCB V9.4.


COMPONENT VALUES
================

The PADS-PCB and PADS2000 files do not contain component values. The POWERPCB 
files do provide this information, embedded in the *MISC* section. For esample,
 D1 and R1 values are defined in the following example:


*MISC*      MISCELLANEOUS PARAMETERS

ATTRIBUTE VALUES
{
PART D1
{
"Description"
"Cost" 
"Part Number" 1N3064
"Manufacturer #1"
}
 PART R1
{
