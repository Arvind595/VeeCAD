Kicad netlist component & netlist definition section:

 ( 22761043 $noname R32 470 {Lib=R}
  (    1 N-000093 )
  (    2 GND )
 )

This format is not suitable for VeecAD because it does not
have a footprint name.

The similar ORCAD PCB2 definition section:

 ( 00000071 1206 R8 22K0
  ( 1 NetR8_1 )
  ( 2 VCC )
 )

This format has a footprint name.


Conclusion : we cannot use the Kicad netlist format.


Kicad emits Orcad PCB 2 that assigns a net named '?' to unconnected 
pins, which causes VeeCAD to (correctly) treat these pins as belonging
to the same net. That wreaks havoc! Added code to VeeCAD to ignore pins with
'?' net name.
