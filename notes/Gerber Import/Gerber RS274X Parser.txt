Gerber RX274X Parser for VeeCAD

The parser assumes the gerber file contains strips - straight lines in the horizontal or vertical direction, with a width of 0.045 of a cell or more : ie. 0.045 inches. The parser ignores circles that are flashed in place.

The parser raises an error if:

  Image polarity is not positive.
  Layer polarity is not positive.
  Coords format is not absolute.
  Macro is executed


The parser ignores:
  Quadrant mode for circles.
  Macro definitions
  Macro execution
  Move to X,Y then Flash commands.


The parser correctly interprets:
  Inch versus millimeter units
  Coords number format
  Aperture definitions
  Aperture selection
  Move to X,Y with exposure off
  Move to x,y with exposure on.
  End of program (file) command

Parser variables.
  Current Location X,y
  Units
  All aperture definitions
			
  

The parser builds a list of tracks :
  Each track has width, start, finish coords (inches)
  

To make board from track list:

  Tracks wider than 0.045" but narrower than 0.09" are made into strips.
  Tracks that are angled or narrower than 0.045" are made into segments
  Track Y coords are inverted.
  The smallest track x and y coord values are found.
  The samllest x and y coord values are subtracted from all x and y coords.
  Tracks with coords falling within 0.005" of exact 0.1" steps, are converted to strips.
  Strip coords are in inches multiplied by 10
  
  


Board manipulation functions:

  * rotate tracks and holes 90 degrees
  * move tracks and holes by x,y cells
  * create tracks from Gerber RX274X file.


Gerber file structure
=====================

CRLF is ignored - lines are for human consumption only.

The basic entity is the data block: these end with '*'


parameter sections : these lie between start & finish '%' characters and contain one or more data blocks.

normal sections : these consist of a single data block containing coordinate information and function codes. A data block can contain function codes only, coords only, or both. When coords and codes appear together, they are taken as a single action to be applied. For example, an "exposure on" code in conjunction with X,Y coords means "turn on exposure", then move to location X,Y.

Parser Construction:
-------------------
ParseParameterSection (lies between a pair of '%' characters.
ParseParameterBlock (one part of a section)
ParseBlock (everything outside of a Parameter section up to next '*' character.

Parser Error Handling
---------------------
Since the parser chews up a string of text with no regard to lines, errors line numbers must be found with a function like that in the JSON parser: function TJsonParser.ScanLine : integer; The function works through the text, counting lines, until the correct offset is found.
